## Mechanics

CYBER // STRIKE has three levels. Progress to the end of the stage and touch the diamond to unlock the next stage.

**Enemies**: the player takes damage upon collision with an enemy. However, if you jump on top of the robots they will be destroyed instead. 

**Movement**: the player has one jump upon reset (collision with the ground). This jump can be used even while the player is falling if it has not been expended. 

Made using custom physics and collision systems.
